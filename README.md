# Diabetes-Prediction- This report demonstrates how to construct and fine-tune a Decision Tree Classifier using the Python Scikit-learn package with the "Diabetes dataset." A decision tree is a tree-like structure in which internal nodes represent features or attributes, branches depict decision rules, and each leaf node signifies an outcome. The primary node at the tree's summit is called the root node. The decision tree learns to divide based on attribute values through recursive partitioning, creating a hierarchical structure. This tree, resembling a flowchart diagram, facilitates decision-making and reflects human-like thought processes. The simplicity and interpretability of decision trees make them accessible for understanding and analysis.
